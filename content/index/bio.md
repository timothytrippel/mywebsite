I am a Senior Software Engineer at Google in ChromeOS working on the
[OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) project.

**_My experience / interests lie at the intersection of hardware and software
co-design, computer architecture, and embedded systems._** I have experience in
low-level firmware development, hardware and firmware fuzzing, pre-silicon
verification, and developing novel security-focused EDA tools for IC design. I
have a background in low-level security research, where I have published several
top-tier conferences papers (e.g, USENIX, Oakland, CHES). I am a top-10
contributor to the open-source OpenTitan project.

Some of my research has directly influenced how MEMS accelerometers are deployed
in embedded
systems<sup><a href="http://www.analog.com/media/en/Other/Support/product-security-response/ADI_Response-ICS_Alert-17-073-01.pdf">1</a>,
<a href="https://psirt.bosch.com/security-advisories/BOSCH-2016-0501.html">2</a></sup>,
and found a flaw in an open-source
<a href="https://opentitan.org/">root-of-trust
chip</a><sup><a href="https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan/commit/1bdcd8e947942d88b5e4d264209a95d2307185df">3</a></sup>.
Additionally, I have developed methodologies and tools to expose security gaps
in hardware designs, both at the RTL and physical-layout levels, using fuzzing
and formal verification strategies.
