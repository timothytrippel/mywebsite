I am a Senior Software Engineer at Google in ChromeOS working on the
[OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) project.

**My experience / interests lie at the intersection of hardware and software
co-design, computer architecture, and embedded systems.** I have experience in
embedded systems software development, IC design (from development to tapeout
and bring-up), IC provisioning, pre/post-silicon verification, secure elements,
and fuzzing. I have a background in low-level security research, where I have
published several top-tier conferences papers (e.g, USENIX, Oakland, CHES). I am
a top-5 contributor to the open-source OpenTitan project, where I contributed to
the first tapeout and bring-up of OpenTita silicon.
