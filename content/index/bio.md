I am a Staff Software Engineer at Google in Platforms Infrastructure Engineering
(PIE) working on the [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) project.

My experience lies in the development of Root-of-Trust hardware for the purpose
of securing data center and client devices to power the AI revolution. For the past
four years I have been part of the core team developing the first ever open
source hardware Root-of-Trust/secure element: OpenTitan. I am the most active
software contributor on the OpenTitan project, and have led several
work streams that resulted in the first successful tapeout and bring-up last
year. I have deep experience in embedded systems software development, DICE
attestation, secure boot, code-signing/HSMs, secure hardware provisioning,
fuzzing, and even IC design (from development and verification to tapeout and
bringup). I also have a background in low-level security research, where I have
published several top-tier conference papers (e.g, USENIX, Oakland, CHES).
