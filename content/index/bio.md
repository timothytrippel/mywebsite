I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Michigan, where I am advised by Professor [Kang G. Shin](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kgshin/) (Michigan) and co-advised by Professor [Matthew Hicks](http://www.impedimenttoprogress.com/) (Virginia Tech). Throughout my academic career I have held several industry research internships, including most recently at Google (on the [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) team) and MIT Lincoln Laboratory (on the [Cyber-Physical Systems](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/cyber-physical-systems) team).

**_My research focuses on hardening the security of computing and sensor hardware from design to deployment._** A central theme in my research is adapting software security methodologies to solve related problems in the hardware domain.

My research has directly influenced how MEMS accelerometers are deployed in
embedded systems<sup><a href="http://www.analog.com/media/en/Other/Support/product-security-response/ADI_Response-ICS_Alert-17-073-01.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://psirt.bosch.com/security-advisories/BOSCH-2016-0501.html">2</a></sup>, and found a flaw in an open-source <a href="https://opentitan.org/">root-of-trust chip</a><sup><a href="https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan/commit/1bdcd8e947942d88b5e4d264209a95d2307185df">3</a></sup>.
Additionally, I have developed methodologies and tools to expose security gaps
in hardware designs, both at the RTL and physical-layout levels.
My work has resulted in several peer-reviewed conference publications,
a U.S. patent, and an industrial R&D award. In 2017, I was awarded the Graduate
Research Fellowship from the National Science Foundation.
