#### I released a preprint of our **Integrated Circuit Attack Surface (ICAS)** work that aims to make security a first class concern during circuit layout by quantifying the susceptibility of integrated circuit layouts to fabrication-time attacks.

You can find the link to the preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08836).
