My research interests focus on hardware security related to cyber-physical systems. From sensors to microprocessors, tiny integrated circuits packed in black boxes, all interconnected on the same printed circuit board, form the foundation of cyber-physical systems. Piled high above, are complex layers of software that blindly trust the hardware below. From design to deployment, my research objective is to secure the foundational hardware that comprise cyber-physical systems as we move into the age of automation. Thus far, I have studied vulnerabilities in cyber-physical systems through signal injection attacks, and developed ways to design and vet hardware for hardware Trojan vulnerabilities.
