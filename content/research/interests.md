My research focuses on hardware security.
From sensors to microprocessors, tiny integrated circuits packed in
black boxes, all interconnected on the same printed circuit board, form the
foundation of all computing systems. Piled high above, are complex layers of
software that blindly trust the hardware below. From design to deployment, my
research aims to secure the foundational hardware that comprise computing
systems as we move into the age of automation. Thus far, I have studied
ways to design, fabricate, and deploy integrated circuit hardware, including
various microprocessors, diverse digital IP blocks, and MEMS inertial sensors.
