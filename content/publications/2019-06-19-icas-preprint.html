    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>
      The transistors used to construct Integrated Circuits (ICs) continue to
      shrink. While this shrinkage improves performance and density, it also
      reduces trust: the price to build leading-edge fabrication facilities has
      skyrocketed, forcing even nation states to outsource the fabrication of
      high-performance ICs. Outsourcing fabrication presents a security threat
      because the black-box nature of a fabricated IC makes comprehensive
      inspection infeasible. Since prior work shows the feasibility of
      fabrication-time attackers’ evasion of existing post-fabrication defenses,
      IC designers must be able to protect their physical designs before handing
      them off to an untrusted foundry. To this end, recent work suggests
      methods to harden IC layouts against attack. Unfortunately, no tool exists
      to assess the effectiveness of the proposed defenses—meaning gaps may
      exist.
      <br />
      <br />
      This paper presents an extensible IC layout security analysis tool called
      IC Attack Surface (ICAS) that quantifies defensive coverage. For
      researchers, ICAS identifies gaps for future defenses to target, and
      enables the quantitative comparison of existing and future defenses. For
      practitioners, ICAS enables the exploration of the impact of design
      decisions on an IC’s resilience to fabrication-time attack. ICAS takes a
      set of metrics that encode the challenge of inserting a hardware Trojan
      into an IC layout, a set of attacks that the defender cares about, and a
      completed IC layout and reports the number of ways an attacker can add
      each attack to the design. While the ideal score is zero, practically, our
      experience is that lower scores correlate with increased attacker effort.
      <br />
      <br />
      To demonstrate ICAS’ ability to reveal defensive gaps, we analyze over 60
      layouts of three real-world hardware designs (a processor and AES and DSP
      accelerators), protected with existing defenses. We evaluate the
      effectiveness of each circuit/defense combination against three attacks
      from the literature. Results show that some defenses are ineffective and
      others, while effective at reducing the attack surface, leave 10’s to
      1000’s of unique attack implementations for an attacker to exploit.
