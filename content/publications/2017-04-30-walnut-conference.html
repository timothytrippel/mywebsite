    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>
      Cyber-physical systems depend on sensors to make automated decisions.
      Resonant acoustic injection attacks are already known to cause
      malfunctions by disabling MEMS-based gyroscopes. However, an open question
      remains on how to move beyond denial of service attacks to achieve full
      adversarial control of sensor outputs. Our work investigates how analog
      acoustic injection attacks can damage the digital integrity of a popular
      type of sensor: the capacitive MEMS accelerometer. Spoofing such sensors
      with intentional acoustic interference enables an out-of-spec pathway for
      attackers to deliver chosen digital values to microprocessors and embedded
      systems that blindly trust the unvalidated integrity of sensor outputs.
      Our contributions include (1) modeling the physics of malicious acoustic
      interference on MEMS accelerometers, (2) discovering the circuit-level
      security flaws that cause the vulnerabilities by measuring acoustic
      injection attacks on MEMS accelerometers as well as systems that employ on
      these sensors, and (3) two software-only defenses that mitigate many of
      the risks to the integrity of MEMS accelerometer outputs.
      <br />
      <br />
      We characterize two classes of acoustic injection attacks with increasing
      levels of adversarial control: output biasing and output control. We test
      these attacks against 20 models of capacitive MEMS accelerometers from 5
      different manufacturers. Our experiments find that 75% are vulnerable to
      output biasing, and 65% are vulnerable to output control. To illustrate
      end-to-end implications, we show how to inject fake steps into a Fitbit
      with a $5 speaker. In our self-stimulating attack, we play a malicious
      music file from a smartphoneâ€™s speaker to control the on-board MEMS
      accelerometer trusted by a local app to pilot a toy RC car. In addition to
      offering hardware design suggestions to eliminate the root causes of
      insecure amplification and filtering, we introduce two lowcost software
      defenses that mitigate output biasing attacks: randomized sampling and
      180&deg; out-of-phase sampling. These software-only approaches mitigate
      attacks by exploiting the periodic and predictable nature of the malicious
      acoustic interference signal. Our results call into question the wisdom of
      allowing microprocessors and embedded systems to blindly trust that
      hardware abstractions alone will ensure the integrity of sensor outputs.
