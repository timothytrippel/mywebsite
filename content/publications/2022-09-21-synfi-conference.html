    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>
      Fault attacks are active, physical attacks that an adversary can leverage
      to alter the control-flow of embedded devices to gain access to sensitive
      information or bypass protection mechanisms. Due to the severity of these
      attacks, manufacturers deploy hardware-based fault defenses into
      security-critical systems, such as secure elements. The development of
      these countermeasures is a challenging task due to the complex interplay
      of circuit components and because contemporary design automation tools
      tend to optimize inserted structures away, thereby defeating their
      purpose. Hence, it is critical that such countermeasures are rigorously
      verified post-synthesis. Since classical functional verification
      techniques fall short of assessing the effectiveness of countermeasures
      (due to the circuit being analyzed when no faults are present), developers
      have to resort to methods capable of injecting faults in a simulation
      testbench or into a physical chip sample. However, developing test
      sequences to inject faults in simulation is an error-prone task and
      performing fault attacks on a chip requires specialized equipment and is
      incredibly time-consuming. Moreover, identifying the fault-vulnerable
      circuit is hard in both approaches, and fixing potential design flaws
      post-silicon is usually infeasible since that would require another
      tape-out. To that end, this paper introduces SYNFI, a formal pre-silicon
      fault verification framework that operates on synthesized netlists. SYNFI
      can be used to analyze the general effect of faults on the input-output
      relationship in a circuit and its fault countermeasures, and thus enables
      hardware designers to assess and verify the effectiveness of embedded
      countermeasures in a systematic and semi-automatic way. The framework
      automatically extracts sensitive parts of the circuit, induces faults into
      the extracted subcircuit, and analyzes the faultsâ€™ effects using formal
      methods. To demonstrate that SYNFI is capable of handling unmodified,
      industry-grade netlists synthesized with commercial and open tools, we
      analyze OpenTitan, the first opensource secure element. In our analysis,
      we identified critical security weaknesses in the unprotected AES block,
      developed targeted countermeasures, reassessed their security, and
      contributed these countermeasures back to the OpenTitan project. For other
      fault-hardened IP, such as the life cycle controller, we used SYNFI to
      confirm that existing countermeasures provide adequate protection.
