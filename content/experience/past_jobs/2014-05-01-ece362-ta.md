**Class**:
[Microprocessor Systems and Interfacing (ECE 362)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/)
&#151; **Supervisor**:
[Prof. David G Meyer](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~meyer/)
<br />
**Description**:
Taught students how to interface microcontrollers with peripheral
components such as LEDs, LCD screens, non-volatile memory, and stepper
motors, and how to write firmware for ADCs, interrupt controllers, PWM modules
and other microcontroller peripherals. As a student in the class the previous
semester, my teammates and I created a water jet audio visualizer cleverly named
[the Aqualizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovuchyM2fDg).
